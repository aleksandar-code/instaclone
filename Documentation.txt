## Documentation standards

Each program or function should have the following information:

### Goals

- What is the goal of the program or function?

### Input

- What (if any) input does the program or function accept?
  Are there any specific data types or ranges?

### Output

- What (if any) output does the program or function return.

### Steps
- What are the steps (written in English) necessary to solve
  this problem. This should NOT be programming code, but each line
  should be specific enough to be translated to a line or two of code
  in your target language.
